# vuejs-messanger-app

This was my first Vue.js and Firebase project. I was learning Vue.js myself and I tried to create a messanger application, that was hosted on Google Firebase and uses Firebase Realtime Database. At first was created with importing Vue.js in a script tag, but as I learned, I updated it to be a proper Vue.js web application.
